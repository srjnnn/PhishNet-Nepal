## 📖 Overview

**PhishNet Nepal** is a cybersecurity education platform that simulates phishing attacks and teaches users — especially **students in Nepal** — how to spot and avoid online scams. Through realistic tests, feedback, and awareness tools, it helps create a safer digital environment for the next generation.

## 🎯 Problem

In Nepal, digital literacy is rising, but awareness about **phishing attacks** is dangerously low. Students and even teachers often don’t recognize fake links, emails, or password traps — making them easy targets.

- Click links, fill forms, and *fail* — but learn safely
- Get instant feedback after every mistake
- Take quizzes and improve their awareness score
- Track their growth and learn over time

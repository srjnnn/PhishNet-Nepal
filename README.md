## 📖 Overview

**PhishNet Nepal** is a platform for cybersecurity education that mimics phishing attempts and instructs users, particularly **students in Nepal**, on how to recognize and steer clear of online scams.  It contributes to the development of a safer digital environment for the upcoming generation by means of practical tests, feedback, and awareness tools.

## 🎯 Problem

Although digital literacy is increasing in Nepal, there remains a dangerously low level of awareness regarding **phishing attacks**.  Teachers and students are easy targets because they frequently fail to spot phony emails, links, or password traps.
